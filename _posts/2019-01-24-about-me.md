I've never had a blog. It may seems boring and some posts maybe short.

As I've already said (in 'about me') In 2016 I graduated Voronezh Institute of the Ministry of the Interior of Russia as an radiocommunications-engineer and came back to my native city Bryansk to work. I got a job in the communications department at the local police department. But in some time I disappointment in this job (it's a different story) and understood that I degraded as a specialist My friend [Alex Klimov](https://vk.com/id4417964) (he works as a programmer) got me advice to try learning programming. In short, I decided to try.

By the way, a month before that I decided to learn English (I'm doing it now). 

My friend Alex got me advise to try learn programming on [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/) as a javascript frontend developer (by the way, in my institute I had programming-lessons and I hated it. We learned C++ and didn't understand what was happening on computer;) ). 

I'll say about my math knowledge - it isn't my strong side. 

I started taking the first courses, and it was incredibly fascinating. I could to sit many hours without any break and solved tasks.

About other things I'll try to talk in next blog.

Also I'll say that I've already done first project (brain games) and I'm leaarning cource - JS-trees now.
