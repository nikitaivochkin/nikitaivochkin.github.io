In a start of learning way my programmer-level was almost equal zero.

For the first time I started learning with UNIX OC because I knew that all development
mainly happen on Linux and similar systems. In that moment I had only computer on windows. I setted Ubunta with VirtualBox's help (last May I become happily owner of an old macbook. Thanks a lot [Alex](https://vk.com/id4417964)).

Mainly I'm learning on [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/).  Hexlet gives fundamental knowledge in programming. I solved lesson by lesson, task by task, little by little understanding basick thisng in this area. 

Oh! I forgot to tell you (reader) why it's need. Since I start learning I definately decided to change my work and my life. My aim is become a programmer and find a job in this area. You may to ask me: Why? Because it's really interesting for me. My dream is to go to job with pleasure!

So it's shortly what I met in that time (one year):
* basic of programming
* [functions](https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/js-functions), [compound data](https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/compound_data), [sequences](https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/sequences), [data directed programming](https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/ddp), [collections](https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/js_collections)
* [git](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
* environment setting (js)
* tried a create a simple [web-site](http://irinaivochkina.info/) (html, css (sass), jquery), website creation by layout
* [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
* basic opportunities of [bash](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash)
* created the first project [brain games](https://github.com/nikitaivochkin/project-lvl1-s280)
* and also to try to find a job ;)

### About first project.
Professions on Hexlet includes projects. This [topic](https://help.hexlet.io/article/29-projects) about projects. 
Before my first project I was really sure that I'm ready. I learned all the necessary recommended courses and took a vacation to will do poject without any problems. 
As a result it was the most difficult challenge in my learning. I couldn't to solve quite easy tasks and I felt stupid. luckily I could finish this project in time. 

### About books.

Hexlet recomends to read some [books](https://ru.hexlet.io/pages/recommended-books). Sadly, but I'm not very friendly with books. In one year I read only two books: 
1. [The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement (Eliyahu M. Goldratt)](https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/28347106/).
2. [Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software (Charles Petzold)](https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/125884/).

I start reading one else book now - one of important book for a programmer - [SICP](https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/5322055/).

### About problems.
As I've already said I'm learning seriously only on Hexlet now and I noticed one not very pleasant tendantion. I don't have all understanding after any course. I was solving quite complicated tasks (like [this one](https://ru.hexlet.io/challenges/js_sequences_queens) and [this one](https://ru.hexlet.io/challenges/js_sequences_hierarchy)) and I've never looked teacher's solution before I get my own solution. Maybe I need to try return to these thems later? I'll do so.

### About English.
In one article about learning English I found this [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_J8gecUO4gsesLXbXfjnNg). With this channel's help I upped my English almost till Intermideate. Also last summer my wife and I during three mounth were visiting English classes. Last autumn I opened [Italki](https://www.italki.com) for me. There my teacher [Alex](https://beta.italki.com/teacher/4630981) (from Mexico) and I were spending great time. It was just conversational practice but so useful and fun. I recomend everyone to try lessons with Alex ;)

### About life.

During this time I began to watch on things differently. Maybe I grew up and understood at last that I need. I don't know how can I explain it ;) 
But I know exactly - programing became more than just hobby for me.

### The nearest plans.

This January I was in vacation and was learning quite intensively The day after tomorrow I come back to my job. It means I won't have lots of time to learning but I'll try to find. During this time I met data directed programming and collections. The nearest aim is trees, prototypes and reiteration last four themes.

#### p.s. 
Yesterday I was listening to Ivan Glushkov podcast where came Kirill Mokevnin. He told about history of Hexlet and some very interesting things. I advise you to listen to. Link to record is [here](https://devzen.ru/episode-0226/).
