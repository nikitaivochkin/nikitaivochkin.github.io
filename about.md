<p>Hello! My name is Nikita.  I'm 26 now. In 2016 I graduated Voronezh Institute of the Ministry of the Interior of Russia as an radiocommunications-engineer. At the end of 2017 I decided to start learning programming.</p>

<p>In this blog I'll share my process and progress in programming.</p>

<p>I'll try to blog in English because it helps me in learning English. But my English lvl isn't very good I can make mistakes ;)</p>
